I am currently a Research Engineer in Facebook AI Research (FAIR). Previously, I graduated with a M.S. degree in Computer Science from the Institute of Computer Science & Technology of Peking University ([**ICST**](http://www.icst.pku.edu.cn)) in 2018, where I worked under the supervision of Prof. [**Jiaying Liu**](http://www.icst.pku.edu.cn/struct/people/liujiaying.html). Before that, I received my B.S. degree in Computer Science from Peking University in 2015.
